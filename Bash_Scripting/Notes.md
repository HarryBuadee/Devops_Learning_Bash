# Bash Scripting Notes

## 1) Shebang

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
- The shebang tells the system to run the script with the Bash shell.
It makes sure the correct interpreter is used, ensuring consistent and reliable behaviour across different environments.

## 2)

```bash
chmod +x script.sh   # Enable execution permissions
./script.sh          # Launch the script
```
## 3)
```

The use of comments is to help explain what the code is doing. Also helps with collaboration.
