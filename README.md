# 🛠️ Bash Scripting Portfolio

Welcome to my **Bash Scripting Portfolio** 👋
This repository documents my Bash scripting journey as part of my broader **Linux, automation, and DevOps upskilling path**.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains **structured Bash scripting exercises** ranging from beginner to more advanced levels. The work focuses on building **practical command-line automation skills** commonly used in IT support, Linux administration, and DevOps-style environments.

The learning approach includes:

* ✅ Hands-on Bash scripting exercises
* ✅ Progressive challenge-based scripts (Levels 1–15)
* ✅ Real-world inspired tasks (file handling, log parsing, validation)
* ✅ Clear focus on readability and safe scripting practices

## 🏆 Bash Battle Arena (Levels 1–15)
Each script in the **Bash Battle Arena** represents a progressive challenge designed to build upon previous concepts.

Highlights include:

- **Level 1 – The Basics**  
  Variables, `echo`, user input, and script execution

- **Level 5 – Combining Basics**  
  Mixing loops, conditionals, file checks, and input handling

- **Level 9 – Directory Monitoring**  
  Detecting changes in directories using Bash logic

- **Level 13 – Backup Script**  
  Creating backups with validation and basic rotation logic

- **Level 15 – Advanced Bash Challenge**  
  Capstone-style script combining arguments, functions, loops, and error handling

---

## 🧪 Additional Bash Exercises
Alongside the structured levels, this repository also includes standalone scripts focused on specific skills:

- Log file searching across directories
- Phrase matching using `grep`
- Sorting files by size
- Arithmetic scripts with input validation
- Linux navigation and scripting comparisons

---

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned
Through these exercises, I’ve developed confidence in:

- Bash scripting fundamentals
- Linux filesystem navigation
- Conditional logic and loops
- Argument parsing and input validation
- Writing readable, maintainable scripts
- Automating repetitive administrative tasks

---

## 🚀 Why Bash?
Bash is foundational to **Linux and Unix-based systems**. Learning Bash has helped me:

- Automate everyday system tasks
- Improve troubleshooting speed in Linux environments
- Build a strong scripting foundation before moving to higher-level tools
- Better understand how DevOps automation works under the hood

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
````
