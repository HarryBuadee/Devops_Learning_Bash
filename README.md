## 🗣️ Interview Talking Points

### What is this repository about?

This repository documents my progression in **Bash scripting**, from core Linux fundamentals to practical automation-style scripts. It shows structured learning and real-world problem solving rather than isolated examples.

### What skills does this demonstrate?

* Bash fundamentals and Linux navigation
* Conditional logic and control flow
* Loops and argument parsing
* File and directory manipulation
* Text processing with standard Unix tools
* Input validation and error handling

### Why did you structure it in levels?

The levels allowed me to build skills incrementally, with each stage building on the last. This mirrors real-world scripting, where simple scripts evolve into more complex automation.

### How is this relevant to real-world IT or Linux roles?

Many scripts reflect real IT scenarios such as checking file existence, searching log files, validating user input, and automating repetitive tasks. These are common tasks in Linux support, system administration, and automation roles.

### Example of a practical script

A log-search script that scans multiple `.log` files for a specific phrase and outputs only the matching filenames. This is useful for troubleshooting services or application errors on Linux systems.

### How do you handle errors in your scripts?

I validate inputs early, check file and directory states before acting, and use clear error messages with exit codes. This helps prevent unintended behaviour and makes scripts safer to run.

### What Bash features are you confident with?

* `if / elif / else` conditionals
* `for` and `while` loops
* Positional arguments (`$1`, `$@`, `$#`)
* Functions and arrays
* Core utilities such as `grep`, `find`, `sort`, and pipes

### What did you find most challenging?

Input validation and argument handling, especially dealing with edge cases. Working through this significantly improved my scripting discipline.

### What would you add next?

More advanced automation such as cron jobs, system monitoring scripts, and deeper text processing using tools like `awk` and `sed`.

> **Summary:** This portfolio demonstrates my ability to write safe, readable Bash scripts that solve real-world Linux and IT problems.
